cforth
======
This is Mitch Bradley's CForth implementation.

This version was derived from the version at One Laptop Per Child,
then it was improved as follows:

a) Host version now has line editing
b) Host version catches exceptions
c) key and key? implemented property in host versions for Linux and Windows
d) Makefile fragments factored better, and use pattern rules extensively
e) Makefiles in build directories simplified


# Smartfusion/TRACERS additions

added subdirectories in build, src/app, src/platform for the SmartFusion A2F500M3G Eval Kit.
